    "**Features related to timings of pauses.** The majority of features we extracted are related to the timings of pauses. Most features are related to the IKI: the time from a key press until the next key press. All time-based features showed a large positive skew. Therefore, these features (except for total time, initial time, and maximum IKI) were log transformed, and all values above the 95^th percentile were removed. Similar approaches can be found in previous studies (*e.g., Grabowski, 2008; Van Waes et al., 2017*).\n",
    "- **Initial pause time:** Time from the start of the keystroke logging (assignment start) until first key press (*Allen et al., 2016; Sinharay et al., 2019*).\n",
    "- **Total time:** Time from start of the keystroke logging (assignment start) to last key release (maximum is 30 min; *Allen et al., 2016; Deane, 2014; Guo et al., 2018*).\n",
    "- **Mean, Median, SD, and maximum IKI:** Metrics of the time from a key press until the next key press (*Allen et al., 2016; Sinharay et al., 2019*).\n",
    "- **Mean and SD IKI within word:** Metrics of all IKI of keystrokes within words (*Deane, 2014; Sinharay et al., 2019*).\n",
    "- **Mean and SD IKI between words:** Metrics of all IKI of keystrokes between words, i.e., the last letter of a word and the space between words (*Deane, 2014; Sinharay et al., 2019*).\n",
    "- **Mean and SD time between words:** Metrics of the time from key press of the last letter of a word until the key press of the first letter of the next word (*Deane, 2014; Guo et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2016*).\n",
    "- **Mean and SD time between sentences:** Metrics of the time from key press of the end of a sentence marker until the key press of the first letter of the next sentence (*Baaijen & Galbraith, 2018; Deane, 2014*).\n",
    "- **Number of IKI of specific length:** Five features were extracted: the number of IKI between 0.5–1.0 s, 1.0–1.5 s, 1.5–2.0 s, 2.0–3.0 s, and larger than 3.0 s (*Allen et al., 2016*).\n",
    "- **Percentage long pauses between words:** Number of pauses between words longer than two SD from the mean IKI within the copy task, divided by the total number of pauses between words (*Baaijen & Galbraith, 2018*).\n",
    "- **Features related to revisions.** Eight features related to revisions were extracted. Again, all time-based features were log transformed and all values above the 95th percentile were removed.\n",
    "- **Number of revisions:** Number of insertions away from the leading edge plus the number of sequences of backspaces and delete keystrokes, that do not contain a pause longer than two SD from the mean IKI within the copy task, and where the cursor was not moved to a different location in the text during the revision (*Barkaoui, 2016*).\n",
    "- **Number of leading-edge revisions:** Number of revisions at the leading edge (pre-contextual revisions; *Barkaoui, 2016*).\n",
    "- **Number of in-text revisions:** Number of revisions away from the leading edge (contextual revisions; *Barkaoui, 2016*).\n",
    "- **Number of backspaces:** Number of backspaces and delete keystrokes (*Allen et al., 2016*).\n",
    "- **Mean and SD time in single backspacing:** Metrics of the duration of a sequence of backspaces or delete keystrokes which included only one backspace or delete keystroke (*Deane, 2014*).\n",
    "- **Mean and SD time in multiple backspacing:** Metrics of the duration of a sequence of backspaces or delete keystrokes which included more than one backspace or delete keystroke (*Deane, 2014*).\n",
    "- **Percentage of characters in final text:** The number of characters in the full text, divided by the total number of keystrokes (*Baaijen & Galbraith, 2018*).\n",
    "- **Percentage of characters at leading edge:** The number of characters typed at the leading edge of the text, divided by the total number of keystrokes, used as a proxy for the size of contextual revisions (cf. *Barkaoui, 2016*).\n",
    "- **Features related to fluency.** Fluency in writing has been argued to be reflected in verbosity (production), process variance, revision, and pausing behavior (*Van Waes & Leijten, 2015*). Here, we solely focus on the burstiness of the writing. Sentences are argued to be composed in sentence parts, also known as written language bursts (*Kaufer et al., 1986*). Written language bursts, hereafter ‘bursts’, are defined as sequences of text production without a long pause and without a focus shift (e.g., to the task or an online dictionary). To account for individual differences in typing speed, all bursts are defined as sequences of keystrokes that do not contain pauses longer than two SD from the mean IKI within the copy task of the same participant (as in *Deane, 2014*).\n",
    "- **Mean, SD, and maximum number of characters per burst:** (*Sinharay et al., 2019*).\n",
    "- **Number of bursts:** (*Sinharay et al., 2019*).\n",
    "- **Percentage of R-bursts:** Number of revision bursts at the leading edge ending in a revision, divided by the total number of bursts (*Baaijen et al., 2012*).\n",
    "- **Percentage of I-bursts:** Number of insertion bursts produced away from the leading edge, divided by the total number of bursts (*Baaijen et al., 2012*).\n",
    "- **Percentage of words in P-bursts:** Number of words in ’clean’ production bursts both initiated and terminated by a long pause (not a revision), divided by the total number of words (*Baaijen et al., 2012*).\n",
    "- **Number of production cycles:** Number of groups of bursts without interruptions by other events (i.e., all events not resulting in a character being typed, see also features related to other events), divided by the number of words (*Baaijen & Galbraith, 2018*\n"
